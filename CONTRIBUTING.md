## How to contribute 👩‍💻

Checkout the only important file! The mighty [`src/setup-spark.ts` ✨](https://github.com/vemonet/setup-spark/blob/main/src/setup-spark.ts)

The Spark installation has been built based on the [jupyter/docker-stack PySpark notebook Dockerfile](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/pyspark-notebook/Dockerfile)

In order to avoid uploading `node_modules/` to the repository, we use [vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to create a single `index.js` file that gets saved in `dist/`.

### Developing

1. Install:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the `index.js` file:

```bash
npm run build
```

This also generates the javascript files from TypeScript files. Any files generated using `tsc` will be added to `lib/`, however those files also are not uploaded to the repository and are excluded using `.gitignore`.

3. Commit and push the generated `index.js` file with the rest of the modified files

### Testing

We use the `test-setup-spark.yml` GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows` to test setting up Spark versions

If you are making a substantive change try to link to a successful run that utilizes the changes you are working on.

### Pull request process

1. Before sending a pull request, make sure the project still work as expected with the new changes properly integrated
2. [Send a pull request](https://github.com/vemonet/setup-spark/compare) to the `main` branch 📤
3. Project contributors will review your change, and answer the pull request as soon as they can
